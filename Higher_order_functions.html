        Higher Order Functions :
            Higher-order functions are an essential concept in JavaScript, where functions can be treated as values, passed as arguments to other functions, or returned from functions. 

        A higher-order function is a function that meets at least one of the following criteria:
            - Takes a function as an argument: It accepts a function as an argument, allowing behavior to be abstracted and     
              parameterized.
            - Returns a function: It generates or creates a new function as its output, enabling the creation of functions    
              dynamically.
     -->

        // Basic Example - Function as an Argument:
        function multiplier(factor) {
            return function (number) {
                return number * factor;
            };
        }

        const double = multiplier(2); // Returns a function that doubles the value
        const triple = multiplier(3); // Returns a function that triples the value

        console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
        console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15

        /*
        Note : Here multiplier is a higher-order function as it returns a new function based on the provided factor. It generates 
               specialized functions (double and triple) that can multiply a number by 2 or 3, respectively.
        */


        // Function Returning a Function:
        function greeter(greeting) {
            return function (name) {
                console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}!`);
            };
        }

        const greetInEnglish = greeter('Hello');
        const greetInSpanish = greeter('Hola');

        greetInEnglish('Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
        greetInSpanish('Bob'); // Output: Hola, Bob!

        // - Closure: With the help of closure functionality When greeter('Hello') or greeter('Hola') is called, it creates a     
        //               closure by preserving the greeting variable's value within the returned function's scope.


        //REal time example 
        // Higher-order function that filters an array based on a condition
        function filterArray(arr, condition) {
            return arr.filter(condition);
        }

        // Example usage:
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

        // Filtering even numbers using the higher-order function
        const evenNumbers = filterArray(numbers, num => num % 2 === 0);
        console.log('Even numbers:', evenNumbers);

        // Filtering numbers greater than 5 using the higher-order function
        const greaterThanFive = filterArray(numbers, num => num > 5);
        console.log('Numbers greater than 5:', greaterThanFive);


        /*  Note : Here
           

            -Higher-order functions enable several advantages in JavaScript:

                Abstraction and Reusability: They allow us to abstract behavior into functions that can be reused across different contexts.
                Functional Composition: Functions can be combined to create more complex functionalities, enabling a cleaner and modular code structure.
                Encapsulation and Closure: They enable the creation of closures, where functions retain access to variables from their containing scope even after the parent function has finished executing.
                Flexibility and Dynamism: They provide flexibility in generating functions dynamically based on conditions or parameters.
                Understanding and effectively using higher-order functions can lead to more elegant and concise code, facilitating better code organization and improved readability in JavaScript.
